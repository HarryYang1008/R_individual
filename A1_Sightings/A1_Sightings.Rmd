# **Introduction**

Major cities face continuous rat infestations that have significant impacts on public health and sanitation standards. The combination of high population density and complex infrastructure in New York City creates continuous difficulties in controlling rodent populations. Researchers analyzed rat sighting reports from 2010 to 2017 to determine patterns, geographical distribution, and seasonal changes in rat infestations. \newline

Kaggle provides the dataset analyzed in this study which consists of public records about rat sightings submitted to New York City's 311 service. The data set records the specific dates and types of locations as well as the boroughs and specific position where rat sightings were reported. \newline

Through report visualization and analysis the study aims to determine which areas experience the worst infestations and what time periods see the highest activity along with potential causal factors. The study's results present important information about rat population distribution patterns in urban settings which will benefit the planning of future urban development and pest management strategies. \newline

# **Analysis by Visualization**
## **Rat Sighting Distribution for Address Type**
![~](output_vis\Distribution.png)
The bar chart displays how rat sightings in New York City vary according to location types. The x-axis on the chart displays the number of reported sightings and the y-axis enumerates the various location types where these sightings took place. The color gradient from yellow to red indicates incident frequency levels where red signifies high counts and yellow indicates lower counts. The highest occurrence of rat sightings is found in buildings with three or more family apartments which surpasses both 1-2 family dwellings and mixed-use buildings. Hospitals, offices, and summer camps experience significantly lower numbers of reported incidents compared to other locations. The data visualization ranks locations by rat infestation reports while showing residential and commercial areas as primary infestation zones. \newline

## **Rat Sighting Trends for Residential Building**
Rat sightings show uneven distribution across location types while multi-family apartment buildings experience the highest levels of infestation. The results prompt an investigation into the temporal evolution of rat infestations within residential spaces. The upcoming visualization analyzes yearly residential trends to show how various housing types influence New York City's rat problem.\newline

![~](output_vis\Residential_trends_stack.png)
The stacked bar chart displays the annual patterns of rat sightings across various residential building types throughout the years 2010 to 2017. The chart categorizes incidents into three building types: The data separates rat sightings into three categories which include 3+ Family Apartment Buildings depicted in red and 1-2 Family Dwellings shown in green along with 3+ Family Mixed-Use Buildings highlighted in purple. The 3+ Family Apartment Buildings show the highest number of rat sightings throughout the years according to the data with a significant rise beginning in 2014 reaching its highest point in 2016 followed by a minor drop in 2017. 1-2 Family Dwellings follow a consistent trend while 3+ Family Mixed-Use Buildings show steady numbers that remain low. The visualization accurately demonstrates the increasing rat problem in multi-family residential buildings throughout the observed period. \newline

**Application of the CRAP Principles ** \newline
**- Contrast: **Distinct color representation of the three categories ensures that they can be easily distinguished from each other. The white background improves readability while grid lines give necessary structure to data without dominating it. \newline

**- Aesthetic Appeal: **The data representation achieves visual appeal and readability through its combination of a well-selected color palette and organized layout. \newpage



## **Rat Sighting Trends for Each Borough**
After known the trends for Rat Sightings in the building/address type, I also want to check how this trend differs among New York City's boroughs. This visualization demonstrates borough-specific patterns by showing which areas have seen the largest growth in rat activity along with the changes in rat sightings over time.

![~](output_vis\borought_trends.png)
The visualization shows the monthly patterns of rat sightings in all five boroughs of New York City including Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island throughout the period from 2010 to 2017. Rat sightings show a steady increase over time with peaks during warm months followed by declines in cold months. Rat incidents reach their peak numbers in Brooklyn and Manhattan but remain minimal in Staten Island. A cyclical pattern emerges in each borough which reflects the seasonal changes in rat activity. The peak in reported rat sightings occurred during 2016 and 2017 which demonstrates a growing issue as time progresses. A multi-line format combined with color coding facilitates straightforward comparisons between boroughs which enables easy identification of city-wide trends. \newline

**Application of the CRAP Principles ** \newline

## **Rat Sighting with Tempreture in Brooklyn**
Brooklyn and Manhattan show the most rat sightings according to borough-level data yet it remains to investigate which external elements are driving these trends. The relationship between temperature fluctuations and rat activity patterns emerges from seasonal variations which we examine by matching temperature data with rat sightings in Brooklyn through subsequent visualization.
![~](output_vis\brooklyn_weather_sightings.png) 


This line chart displays data on Brooklyn's monthly rat sightings from 2010 to 2017 together with trends in average temperature. The purple line tracks rat sightings and the red line shows average temperature using a secondary axis for comparison. The chart demonstrates that rat sightings reach their highest levels during warmer periods but drop during colder periods which indicates temperature changes may influence rat activity levels. The data demonstrates a rising trend in rat sightings throughout the years especially after 2014 though significant fluctuations exist. The visualization uses a dual-axis format to merge two interrelated variables which demonstrates potential environmental impacts on rodent population patterns. \newline

**Application of the CRAP Principles ** \newline

### **Rat Sighting and Population in Brooklyn Borough**
Seasonal rat activity depends heavily on temperature readings while population density and human activities remain critical factors in controlling infestation rates. This visualization enables spatial analysis by mapping Brooklyn’s population together with rat sighting locations to show  how the different human  activity level will effect the rat sightings.\newline
![~](output_vis\brooklyn_population_density_map.png)
The interactive map demonstrates how Brooklyn's population density intersects with reported rat sightings from 2017 to analyze potential relationships between popultaion and rat sighting report. The map uses colored regions to show population density where darker colors represent areas with greater population density. The blue dots on this map represent locations where rat sightings have been reported to show how they are distributed throughout various neighborhoods. Northern and central Brooklyn display more rat sightings in their densely populated regions, and with this area as the center, it affects the surrounding area.. The provided visualization enables users to discover areas with intense rodent activity which might be shaped by waste disposal practices and human density alongside infrastructure conditions. The map demonstrates where rat infestations peak by superimposing rat sighting data onto Brooklyn's detailed geographic representation. \newline

**Application of the CRAP Principles ** \newline
**- Contrast:** The population gradient color scale allows users to easily differentiate between varying levels. The blue dots indicating rat sightings are clearly visible because they stand out from the background. \newline
**- Repetition:** Consistent gridlines and fonts along with uniform data layering methods ensure the map remains visually coherent. \newline
**- Alignment:** The title, legend, and axis labels maintain proper positioning which facilitates easy understanding while supporting a balanced and organized layout. \newline
**- Proximity:** By placing rat sighting points directly on the population density map their relationship becomes more apparent. The legend placement at the right side ensures visibility while avoiding disruption to the map visualization. \newline

**Application of Great Visualization Principles (Kieran Healy & Alberto Cairo)** \newline
**- Kieran Healy’s **Clarity: Viewers get a straightforward depiction of Brooklyn's population densities alongside rat infestations using an uncluttered map layout. \newline
**- Alberto Cairo’s Truthfulness: **The map provides precise representation of data while maintaining geographical correctness and avoiding any distortions in the locations of rat sightings or population density scales. \newline
**- Comparability:** The combination of population density information with rat sighting data allows viewers to make straightforward comparisons between different regions while recognizing infestation trends. \newline
**- Functionality:** Through a map format viewers can effectively perform spatial analysis to observe infestation concentration areas in relation to population density levels. \newline
**- Aesthetic Appeal:** The map's smooth color gradients together with clear labeling and structured elements deliver an informative and visually appealing depiction of urban rodent activity. \newline


# **Counclution**
New York City rat sightings between 2010 and 2017 demonstrate the expansion of the rodent problem in densely packed residential zones. The most frequent rat sightings occur in multi-family apartment buildings which suggests that both housing density and waste management methods are likely contributing factors to these infestations. After 2014 there was a significant rise in rat reports which points to possible alterations in urban infrastructure development or reporting processes. The impact of climate on rodent behavior becomes evident through seasonal patterns that show warmer temperatures lead to increased rat activity. Data comparing boroughs shows Brooklyn and Manhattan as the most heavily impacted by rat infestations in their densely populated neighborhoods. The spatial analysis of rat sightings in Brooklyn reveals that densely populated areas suffer the most infestations because human activities like improper waste disposal and poor sanitation facilitate rodent growth. The findings demonstrate that pest control methods must be specifically developed for densely populated urban areas with high infestation rates.
